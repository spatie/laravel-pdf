You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require spatie/laravel-pdf
```

Under the hood this package uses [Browsershot](https://spatie.be/docs/browsershot) to generate PDFs. You'll need to install the required dependencies for Browsershot to work. You can find the instructions [here](https://spatie.be/docs/browsershot/v4/requirements).
